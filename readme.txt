1. Language used - Python2
2. Specify the number of memory locations need to be allocated for 40 bit Instructions.
3. The last instruction should be a halt instruction.
4. If no left instruction is present then the first 20 bits of the memory location should be "00000000000000000000"(20 bit zero string).  
5. The 40 bit string "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" represent the Halt instruction.
6. Specify the number of memory locations need to be allocated for Data. 
7. Specify the address (in decimal) and the data (in decimal). 
8. The memory follows 0 based indexing.
9. IMPORTANT NOTE: The memory contains all the Instructions first and then follwed by Data.
10. Sample Hard coded programs are commented out in the program.
